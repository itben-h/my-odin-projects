        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place egg in a shallow dish. Place panko, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper into a large zip-top freezer bag and mix well.</li>
            <li>Dip 2 chicken strips into egg, then place into panko mixture and shake to coat. Place coated chicken pieces onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken. Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice.</li>
            <li>Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the oven.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
